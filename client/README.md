## Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter that works with most frontend languages. It is used to keep the look of code consistent across multiple developers. To install prettier and get it working in your local environment see the following steps (assuming your using VSCode):

1. Install [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) from the VSCode extensions marketplace.

2. Add the following to your VSCode settings file:

   ```json
   "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
   "prettier.requireConfig": true,
   ```

3. Optionally add the following to your VSCode settings file if you prefer to only format on save:
   ```json
     "editor.formatOnSave": true,
   ```

Prettier should now be formatting your code! Note in the root of the project your will find a `.prettierrc` file. This is the config file prettier will use to style the code in this project.

## ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native Snippets

This [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) provides some helpful snippets for react apps.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
